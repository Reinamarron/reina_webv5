Notes for Reina by Amanda:

Overall everything looks really good! 
Here are the notes I have from reviewing your code:

Site
White font is difficult to read on some images. 
I would suggest using opacity on the pictures so that it makes it easier to read.
I would also see if you can make your email address and footer nav font colors different. 
The blue on blue is hard to read as well.

Code
I would consider removing unnecessary id tags.
I noticed you have id tags on almost all your elements but are not calling on any of them in your CSS (aside from your links of course).
That would clean up your code and make it easier to navigate.

I would also look at removing any CSS you are not using. 
I know this is still a work in progress so you probably are already planning to do this :).
